# request

Submit cloud resource, application environment, or ticket/work order requests through the service catalog.

## Flow

Seven tools exist: `smartcmp_list_services`, `smartcmp_list_available_bgs`, `smartcmp_list_flavors`, `smartcmp_list_facets`, `smartcmp_list_resource_bundles`, `smartcmp_submit_request`, and `smartcmp_get_request_status`.

### Multi-resource routing boundary

This skill is for one CMP request flow at a time. That single flow may still
represent one service catalog / one resource type / one shared parameter set
with quantity N.

Keep the request in this skill when the user wants multiple instances of the
same resource type with the same configuration, for example:

- "several identical Linux VMs for one project"
- "multiple instances of the same database service with shared parameters"
- "quantity N of one resource type with one shared parameter set"

Route to `request-decomposition-agent` only when the request needs to be split
into distinct sub-requests, especially when the user gives:

- multiple resource types in one ask
- per-instance differences such as "first ..., second ..., third ..."
- different specs per instance
- mixed roles/components that should become separate CMP requests

Quantity by itself is **not** a decomposition signal. The request workflow and
submit tool should interpret same-type quantity from the user's original
language without requiring AtlasClaw core to pre-structure `resource_count`.

When this boundary is hit, do not continue with the single-catalog parameter
collection flow in this skill.

### Single-instance vs shared-quantity contract

This skill supports two request shapes, and they are not interchangeable:

- **Single-instance request**: one resource type, one instance, one
  `resourceSpecs` item, and no top-level count field unless the selected
  catalog explicitly requires one.
- **Same-type multi-instance request**: one resource type, one shared
  parameter set, one explicit quantity value from the selected catalog schema
  or fallback `quantity`, with `resourceSpecs` following the selected catalog
  schema.

For same-type multi-instance requests:

- Read the selected catalog instructions before choosing the quantity key. If
  an active field in `instructions.topLevelFields` or `instructions.params`
  clearly declares instance quantity, use that exact key and location. Do not
  choose from a fixed alias list.
- If the selected catalog does not declare a quantity/count field, use fallback
  top-level `quantity`.
- When the selected catalog has one `instructions.resourceSpecs` item, keep one
  shared `resourceSpecs` item for the shared parameter set.
- When the selected catalog declares multiple `instructions.resourceSpecs`
  items, build each declared item exactly once; do not treat the number of
  specs as the requested instance count.
- Do **not** duplicate identical `resourceSpecs` entries just to represent
  quantity N.
- Do **not** invent per-instance names, hostnames, IPs, disk sizes, or other
  per-instance overrides when the user asked for shared parameters.
- If the user supplies per-instance differences, separate names for each
  instance, or mixed component roles, stop using this skill and route to
  `request-decomposition-agent`.

Do not infer decomposition solely from `resourceSpecs` length. A single catalog
can legitimately declare multiple resource specs. Decomposition is driven by
user semantics, such as separate CMP requests or per-instance differences, not
by a submit-script spec-count heuristic.

### Submitted request status flow

Use `smartcmp_get_request_status` only for submitted request status or
approval-result checks. Pass an explicit Request ID when present. For "刚才提交的
申请", reuse the most recent `smartcmp_submit_request` Request ID in this
conversation; if none exists, ask for the Request ID. Request IDs are
user-facing values such as `REQ20260501000095`, `RES20260501000095`,
`TIC20260316000001`, or `CHG20260413000011`. Never pass UUID-shaped internal
identifiers to the status tool.

The status script returns structured fields only. Treat the tool output as
lookup data, not final user-facing text. Explain the result in the current user's message language using
`state`, `statusCategory`, `approvalPassed`, `currentStep`, `currentApprover`,
`provisionState`, `error`, and `updatedAt`.

Status semantics:
- `APPROVAL_PENDING`: not approved yet; approval is still pending.
- `APPROVAL_REJECTED` / `APPROVAL_RETREATED`: not approved; rejected or returned.
- `STARTED` / `TASK_RUNNING` / `WAIT_EXECUTE` / `FINISHED`: approval has passed or the request has entered later execution.
- `INITIALING` / `INITIALING_FAILED` / `FAILED` / `CANCELED`: report the current state as initialization, failure, or cancellation; do not claim approval or rejection.

### Complete flow

1. Call `smartcmp_list_services` once. Auto-select a catalog only when the
   user's wording clearly matches one returned catalog; otherwise ask a
   numbered catalog-selection question.
2. Call `smartcmp_list_available_bgs` with the selected catalog UUID. If one
   business group is returned, use it. If multiple are returned, ask a concise
   numbered question using display names only and wait for the user's
   selection. Do not show business group IDs to the user.
3. Before asking for request fields, check the selected catalog metadata. If a
   ticket/work-order catalog (`serviceCategory: "GENERIC_SERVICE"`) has
   `instructions.genericRequest`, build from that metadata. If a cloud/resource
   catalog has no `instructions.resourceSpecs` but its selected catalog metadata
   has `type: "cloudchef.nodes.Compute"`, use the Compute fallback below. If it
   has no Markdown and is not Compute, stop and explain that the catalog is
   missing generated Markdown instructions.
4. Build the request from the selected catalog's generated Markdown metadata:
   `instructions.resourceSpecs`, `instructions.genericRequest`, and
   `instructions.topLevelFields`.
5. Ask only for active required fields with no default, plus fields explicitly
   marked `ask: true`. Defaults are used silently.
6. Show a JSON preview and ask for confirmation.
7. After the user confirms, call `smartcmp_submit_request` with the preview JSON.

Steps 1 and 2 are mandatory for every new request. Never ask the user to type a
business group before calling `smartcmp_list_available_bgs`.

### Catalog identity contract

- Displayed service list numbers are conversation choices only. Resolve them
  against the latest `smartcmp_list_services` result.
- `catalogId` must be the selected catalog metadata UUID, never the displayed
  list number and never `sourceKey`.
- After catalog selection, the next tool call must be
  `smartcmp_list_available_bgs` with that UUID.
- There is no catalog questionnaire/default-property/preview tool in this
  skill. Do not invent one.

### Tool sequencing

- One lookup tool call per turn.
- After a lookup tool result, summarize the resolved result in natural language
  and ask at most one next question.
- Do not paste raw tool output, `_internal` metadata, UUID dumps, or JSON meta
  blocks into the reply.
- If the previous assistant message asked the user to choose a business group
  and the user replies with a bare number or group name, treat it as a business
  group selection, never as an unsupported operation.
- In a tool-required turn after a business group selection, call
  `smartcmp_list_available_bgs` again with the same selected catalog UUID to
  refresh the business group list, resolve the user's selection against that
  result, then continue with generated Markdown, Compute fallback, or the JSON
  preview.
- During request building, do not call datasource-only tools such as
  `smartcmp_list_components`, `smartcmp_list_applications`, or
  `smartcmp_list_images`. The selected catalog metadata and generated Markdown
  are the request contract.

## User Response Language

- Use the current user's language for user-facing replies.
- Keep JSON keys, API fields, catalog names, provider names, and tool names
  unchanged.
- In Chinese user-facing text, always call SmartCMP resource pools `资源池`.
  Never call them `资源包`. Keep API field names such as `resourceBundleId` and
  `resourceBundleTags` unchanged inside JSON or code.

## Generated Markdown Instructions

Catalog `instructions` is expected to be the Markdown generated by the Java
catalog instruction builder. For request building, only these sections are in
scope:

- `# Request Parameter Instructions`: YAML parameter contract.
- `# Request Instructions`: optional request-building guidance.

`smartcmp_list_services` exposes the parsed `# Request Parameter Instructions`
YAML as selected catalog metadata:

- `instructions.topLevelFields`
- `instructions.topLevelRequired`
- `instructions.params`
- `instructions.genericRequest`
- `instructions.resourceSpecs`
- `instructions.requestInstructions` from exactly `# Request Instructions`,
  when that section exists

Ignore old JSON instruction payloads. Do not use `instructions.parameters` or
legacy raw `params` as the request schema. Use `instructions.params` only when
it is parsed from `# Request Parameter Instructions`.

### Instruction section boundary

The catalog Markdown body may contain multiple instruction sections, such as
`# Request Parameter Instructions`, `# Request Instructions`,
`# Preapproval Instructions`, or other future sections. For this request skill,
only `# Request Parameter Instructions` and `# Request Instructions` are in
scope.

- Read `# Request Parameter Instructions` first; it is the authoritative schema
  contract.
- The `# Request Instructions` section is optional. If it is absent, use
  `# Request Parameter Instructions` only.
- For free-form Markdown instructions, read only the content under exactly
  `# Request Instructions`.
- Stop reading request instructions at the next same-level heading that starts
  with `# `, such as `# Preapproval Instructions`.
- Never fall through to `# Preapproval Instructions` or any other section when
  `# Request Instructions` is missing.
- Ignore all other sections for request building. They must not change required
  fields, defaults, `when` behavior, resource tag handling, payload shape, or
  submit/preview behavior.
- A catalog body with only `# Preapproval Instructions` has no request-body
  instructions. It is still requestable only if `# Request Parameter
  Instructions` contains enough request schema metadata.

### Markdown field rules

- Top-level JSON always includes `catalogId`, `catalogName`,
  `businessGroupId`, and `name`.
- For same-type multi-instance requests with shared parameters, fill the
  selected catalog's declared quantity field in its exact declared location. If
  none exists, use fallback top-level `quantity`. Keep `resourceSpecs` aligned
  to the selected catalog schema; for a single-spec catalog, use one shared
  `resourceSpecs[]` item.
- Quantity alone does not require decomposition; per-instance differences do.
- Generated field attributes belong in `# Request Parameter Instructions`, not
  in the `# Request Instructions` prose. Keep field metadata such as `type`,
  `required`, `defaultValue`, `default_value`, `when`, `ask`, `label`,
  `description`, `source`, lookup hints, and selectable values on the declared
  field itself.
- If an active field declares static `options`, use option `id` as the payload
  value and display option labels only as user-facing help.
- Do not add a second field-property list after body text such as "Do not
  invent fields that are not declared in `# Request Parameter Instructions`."
  Treat the body as generic request guidance only.
- If `topLevelFields.name.ask: true` and the user has not supplied a name, ask
  for the request/resource name. Do not auto-generate it.
- Do not include `userLoginId`; `submit.py` injects it.
- Put root request fields declared in `instructions.params.<key>` under the
  top-level JSON object `params.<key>`. These are catalog form fields from
  `catalog.form_definition_id`, not resource spec fields.
- Root `instructions.params` fields follow the same active-field rules as
  resource fields: evaluate `when`, use defaults silently, show static
  `options`, ask only for active required/no-default or `ask: true` fields, and
  omit inactive or empty optional fields.
- Do not put root `instructions.params` fields into
  `resourceSpecs[].params`. Do not put `resourceSpecs[].params` fields into the
  top-level `params` object.
- For ticket/work-order catalogs (`serviceCategory: "GENERIC_SERVICE"`) with
  `instructions.genericRequest`, build a `genericRequest` object instead of
  `resourceSpecs`. Put `instructions.genericRequest.description` at
  `genericRequest.description`. Put fields declared under
  `instructions.genericRequest.processForm.<key>` at
  `genericRequest.processForm.<key>`. Follow the same active-field rules:
  evaluate `when`, use defaults silently, ask only for active required/no-default
  or `ask: true` fields, and omit inactive or empty optional fields.
- For each `instructions.resourceSpecs[]`, create one `resourceSpecs[]` item
  and copy `node` and `type` exactly when present.
- Treat field schemas declared directly on `instructions.resourceSpecs[]`,
  other than `node`, `type`, `resourceBundleId`, `resourceBundleTags`,
  `resourceBundleParams`, and `params`, as direct resource spec fields. Put each
  active value directly on the same `resourceSpecs[]` item as `<key>`. These
  fields are for special resources such as Compute/VM, where SmartCMP expects
  values like `computeProfileId`, `flavorId`, `logicTemplateId`, `templateId`,
  `credentialUser`, `credentialPassword`, `networkId`, `securityGroupIds`, or
  `systemDisk` at `resourceSpecs[]` level rather than under `params`.
- Preserve each direct field's declared type from Markdown. In particular,
  serialize Compute `securityGroupIds` as a JSON array of security group id
  strings, even when only one security group is selected; never serialize it as
  a single string or comma-separated string.
- Direct resource spec fields declared with `type: "object"` must be serialized
  as JSON objects at `resourceSpecs[]` level. For Compute `systemDisk`, preserve
  the object shape from Markdown or user input, for example
  `"systemDisk": {"size": <disk size>}`. Never serialize `systemDisk` as a raw
  number or string, and never move it under `params`.
- For direct Compute fields, use the exact field names declared by generated
  Markdown, such as `computeProfileName`, `cpu`, and `memory`. Do not replace
  them with alternate fields such as `computeProfileId` unless the selected
  catalog declares those alternate fields.
- Do not create or consume a literal `fields` object. Direct resource spec
  fields must be declared directly on `instructions.resourceSpecs[]`.
- Put `resourceBundleTags` at the same level as `resourceBundleId`,
  `resourceBundleParams`, and `params` in Markdown. If it is active and has no
  `defaultValue` / `default_value`, call `smartcmp_list_facets` after
  business group selection with `node_type` from that spec's `type`, then ask
  the user to choose resource tags. Serialize selected values at
  `resourceSpecs[].resourceBundleTags` as `["<facet.key>:<option.key>"]`.
- `resourceBundleTags` and `resourceBundleId` are mutually exclusive for the
  same `resourceSpecs[]` item. If both are declared and active, use
  `resourceBundleTags` and omit both `resourceBundleId` and
  `resourceBundleParams`.
- If `resourceBundleId.defaultValue` exists and no active `resourceBundleTags`
  is used for that spec, put that value at `resourceSpecs[].resourceBundleId`.
- If an active `resourceBundleId` has no default and no active
  `resourceBundleTags`, call `smartcmp_list_resource_bundles` after business
  group selection and ask the user to choose one. Use the selected bundle `id`
  at `resourceSpecs[].resourceBundleId`.
- For `smartcmp_list_resource_bundles`, pass `business_group_id` from the
  selected business group, `node_type` from `resourceSpecs[].type`, and
  `component_type` from `instructions.componentType` / catalog
  `component_type`, falling back to catalog `sourceKey` only when generated
  Markdown does not declare it.
- Put `resourceBundleParams.<key>` values under
  `resourceSpecs[].resourceBundleParams.<key>`.
- `resourceBundleParams` is only for defaulted resource-pool placement fields
  declared there, such as `available_zone_id` and `resource_group_id`. Include
  those fields only when they already have a non-empty default value. Do not ask
  the user for missing `resourceBundleParams`; omit them instead. VPC, VSwitch,
  subnet, security group, and other network configuration fields must be under
  `resourceSpecs[].params` unless generated Markdown declares them directly on
  the resource spec, such as Compute `networkId` and `securityGroupIds`.
- Put `params.<key>` values under `resourceSpecs[].params.<key>`.
- External API lookup fields such as VPC, VSwitch, subnet, security group, and
  table-async selections, including direct Compute lookup fields, should appear
  in generated Markdown only when they already have a non-empty default. If old
  Markdown still declares one of these lookup fields without a default, omit it
  and do not ask the user for an internal id.
- Use `defaultValue` / `default_value` silently. Do not ask the user whether to
  modify a default.
- When an active field has static `options`, always show the option labels and
  ids as user-facing help when collecting remaining fields or showing the
  preview summary. This applies even when the field has a default. Do not ask a
  blocking question only for that defaulted field, but make alternatives clear
  so the user can override the default before confirmation.
- Format defaulted static options like:
  `地址类型: 默认 internet（公网）；可选：internet=公网，intranet=私网`.
- Ask only when an active required field has no default, or when a field has
  `ask: true`, except missing `resourceBundleParams` values, which are omitted.
- Optional fields without a user value or non-empty default are omitted.
- Never serialize metadata keys such as `type`, `required`, `defaultValue`,
  `default_value`, `when`, `source`, `label`, `ask`, or `options`.

### `when` rules

- Evaluate `when` before asking or serializing a field.
- If `when` is false, the field is inactive: do not ask for it and do not
  include its default.
- Evaluate from already resolved values in the same spec.
- Treat unquoted right-hand words as string literals:
  `AddressType == intranet` means `AddressType == "intranet"`.
- Boolean values use `true` and `false`.
- If the user explicitly provides a value for a field with a default, use the
  user value and re-evaluate dependent `when` fields.

### Request shape

```json
{
  "catalogId": "<selected catalog UUID>",
  "catalogName": "<selected catalog name>",
  "businessGroupId": "<selected business group id>",
  "name": "<user-provided request name>",
  "quantity": 3,
  "resourceSpecs": [
    {
      "node": "<from instructions.resourceSpecs[].node>",
      "type": "<from instructions.resourceSpecs[].type>",
      "resourceBundleId": "<from resourceBundleId default or selected resource pool id>",
      "resourceBundleTags": ["<facet.key>:<option.key>"],
      "resourceBundleParams": {
        "<key>": "<active value>"
      },
      "<directResourceSpecKey>": "<active value>",
      "params": {
        "<key>": "<active value>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "params": {
    "<key>": "<active value from instructions.params>"
  }
}
```

Omit empty objects. Do not move `resourceBundleId` into either top-level
`params` or `resourceSpecs[].params`, do not put declared `resourceBundleParams`
fields inside any `params`, and do not put network fields inside
`resourceBundleParams`. Never include `resourceBundleId` or
`resourceBundleParams` when `resourceBundleTags` is used in the same spec. Do
not serialize a `fields` wrapper. Serialize each active direct resource-spec
field schema as `resourceSpecs[].<key>`. Same-type multi-instance requests must
use the catalog-declared quantity field or fallback `quantity`; never duplicate
identical `resourceSpecs[]` entries just to represent quantity. Catalogs that
declare multiple `resourceSpecs` should include each declared item once.
For Compute, `securityGroupIds` must be an array, for example
`"securityGroupIds": ["sg-xxxxxxxx"]`.
For Compute, `systemDisk` must be an object, for example
`"systemDisk": {"size": <disk size>}`.

Ticket/work-order generated Markdown request shape:

```json
{
  "catalogId": "<selected catalog UUID>",
  "catalogName": "<selected catalog name>",
  "businessGroupId": "<selected business group id>",
  "name": "<user-provided request name>",
  "genericRequest": {
    "description": "<active value from instructions.genericRequest.description>",
    "processForm": {
      "<key>": "<active value from instructions.genericRequest.processForm>"
    }
  }
}
```

Omit `genericRequest.processForm` when no form fields are declared or active.

## Business-Group Resolution

- Use `smartcmp_list_available_bgs` as the authoritative source.
- If the user already specified a tenant / 租户 / 部门 / BU / 项目 and it
  uniquely matches an available business group, use that business group.
- If multiple groups remain, ask one concise numbered question with group names
  only. Do not display business group UUIDs.
- Use the selected business group's `id` as top-level `businessGroupId`.
- If a request name is still missing when asking for business group selection,
  ask for both in the same sentence, for example: `请回复业务组编号和资源名称，例如：2 slbtest01`.

## Service Selection

- Call `smartcmp_list_services` once at the start of a new request.
- Match user wording against returned catalog name, `sourceKey`, and service
  category.
- If multiple catalogs could match, ask a numbered catalog-selection question.
- When the user selects by number, resolve the number to the selected catalog
  metadata UUID before calling any next tool.

## Runtime Lookups

Use extra lookup tools only when generated Markdown requires or explicitly asks
for a value that cannot be taken from the user or a default.

- `smartcmp_list_facets`: use only when generated Markdown declares an active
  `resourceBundleTags` field without a default. Pass `node_type` from
  `resourceSpecs[].type`. Build tag values as `["<facet.key>:<option.key>"]`
  from the API response.
- `smartcmp_list_resource_bundles`: use only when generated Markdown declares
  an active `resourceBundleId` field without a default and no active
  `resourceBundleTags` field. Pass the selected business group id,
  `component_type`, and `node_type`. The tool applies fixed
  `strategy=RB_POLICY_STATIC`, `enabled=true`, and `readOnly=false` filters.
- `smartcmp_list_flavors`: use only when generated Markdown declares an active
  required compute-profile field without a default and the value must be chosen
  from SmartCMP flavor data, or when the selected catalog is a no-Markdown
  Compute fallback and the user provided a spec such as `2c4g`.
- Do not call those tools for fields that already have active defaults.

### Facet lookup result handling

After `smartcmp_list_facets` returns, treat the result as selectable resource
tag data only:

- Do not call `smartcmp_list_components` or any other datasource tool to
  interpret facet results.
- Do not display raw facet records, `id`, `aspects`, `createdBy`, timestamps,
  lock versions, deleted flags, or JSON meta blocks.
- Use the compact `FACET_META` data from the tool result. The payload shape is
  `[{ "key": "<facet key>", "label": "<display label>", "options": [{ "key": "<option key>", "label": "<display label>" }] }]`.
- If the user already supplied a tag/environment word, match it against facet
  option `key` or `label`. If exactly one option matches, use it.
- If exactly one active facet and one option are available, use that option.
- Otherwise ask one concise numbered question using display labels only, for
  example: `请选择资源环境：1. 开发 2. 测试 3. 生产`.
- When asking the facet question, stop and wait for the user's answer. Do not
  show a JSON preview in the same reply.
- Store selected tags only as `"<facet.key>:<option.key>"` strings in
  `resourceSpecs[].resourceBundleTags`.

## Missing Markdown

If a cloud/resource catalog has no `instructions.resourceSpecs`, use Compute
fallback only when the selected catalog metadata explicitly has
`type: "cloudchef.nodes.Compute"`. For other cloud/resource catalogs, do not
guess provider-specific request fields and do not submit. Explain that the
catalog is missing generated Markdown instructions.

### Compute fallback

This fallback keeps legacy Linux VM / Windows VM catalogs usable while newer
cloud component catalogs use generated Markdown.

Use Compute fallback only when all of these are true:

- The selected catalog has no `instructions.resourceSpecs`.
- The selected catalog metadata has `type: "cloudchef.nodes.Compute"`.
- Business group has already been resolved through `smartcmp_list_available_bgs`.

Compute fallback sequence:

1. Ask for missing request `name` and `description`, plus VM login user/password
   if they were not provided. Mask `credentialPassword` in previews.
2. Call `smartcmp_list_facets` with the selected `businessGroupId` to choose
   resource pool tags. Use returned `facet.key` and option key, not display
   labels.
3. Call `smartcmp_list_flavors` when the user supplied a spec such as `2c4g`,
   or ask the user to choose a flavor if no unambiguous match exists. Use the
   flavor `id` as `computeProfileId`.
4. Build one `resourceSpecs[]` item using selected catalog `node` and `type`
   when present.

Compute fallback JSON shape:

```json
{
  "catalogId": "<selected catalog UUID>",
  "catalogName": "<selected catalog name>",
  "businessGroupId": "<selected business group id>",
  "name": "<user-provided request name>",
  "description": "<user-provided request description>",
  "resourceSpecs": [
    {
      "node": "<selected catalog node, when present>",
      "type": "cloudchef.nodes.Compute",
      "resourceBundleTags": ["<facet.key>:<option.key>"],
      "computeProfileId": "<flavor id>",
      "credentialUser": "<user-provided login user>",
      "credentialPassword": "<user-provided login password>"
    }
  ]
}
```

For ticket/work-order catalogs (`serviceCategory: "GENERIC_SERVICE"`) without
generated `instructions.genericRequest` Markdown, submit only this minimal shape
after collecting `name` and description:

```json
{
  "catalogId": "<selected catalog UUID>",
  "catalogName": "<selected catalog name>",
  "businessGroupId": "<selected business group id>",
  "name": "<user-provided request name>",
  "genericRequest": {
    "description": "<user-provided description>"
  }
}
```

## Submit Contract

Before submit:

1. Show a short summary in the user's language.
2. Show `JSON 预览` / `JSON Preview` with a fenced JSON block.
3. Mask `credentialPassword` as `"******"`.
4. Ask the user to confirm.
5. Stop. Do not call `smartcmp_submit_request` until the user confirms.

After confirmation:

- User says yes → call `smartcmp_submit_request` with `json_body`.
- User says no → ask what to change.
- A bare number is a selection for the latest displayed list unless the
  immediately previous assistant message displayed a JSON preview and asked for
  confirmation.

## Interaction Rules

- `smartcmp_list_services` at most once per request conversation.
- `smartcmp_list_available_bgs` is normally called once after catalog
  selection. It may be called one extra time only to resolve a user's business
  group selection in a tool-required turn.
- Never claim submitted unless `smartcmp_submit_request` actually executed.
- Never display raw internal metadata to the user.
